This repository contains the python script for a combined eye tracking and response time experiment. This was used to collect data using an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker. This script was used to collect data on response time (button press) and eye tracking (fixations). 
Lines 84 to 1063, with integration, should run and collect response time measures in PsychoPy.
